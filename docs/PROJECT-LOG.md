## §1 — Goal status (keep current)

**Updated: 2026-06-06.**
- **Goal (SSOT `docs/v6-fire-planner-product-plan.md` §9):** research-grounded Indian FIRE planning
  SaaS — correct, honest, sticky, friction-free — serving the **urban salaried accumulator** across
  the whole FIRE lifecycle (5 objectives: effortless setup · honest number · get-there-faster ·
  readiness-to-stop · stay-free-post-FIRE).
- **Realization: ~30–40%.** Production-live (https://firekaro.com since 2026-06-01); the
  **correctness/honesty foundation (objective 1) is the strong win**; objectives 0/2/3/4 are
  partial-to-early; **stickiness is unproven (zero retained users, retention unmeasured).**
- Calling the goal "achieved" would be the optimism-error the honesty mandate exists to prevent.

---

## §2 — Active priority / roadmap (the "Now" order: correctness → stickiness → friction)

**Current focus chosen 2026-06-06 (REPRIORITIZED by Abhay): COMPLETE THE MUST-HAVE CORE before
stickiness.** Rationale (goal-anchored): there is no point measuring/improving retention on an
incomplete product — a working must-have core is the *precondition* for stickiness. **Scope locked
(D-2026-06-06-07): must-have-now = the accumulation core, objectives 0+1+2; objectives 3+4
(readiness-to-stop, post-FIRE) are the wedge persona's LATER lifecycle — math already built, only UI
missing — sequenced to a later phase.**

**Completeness audit (4 parallel assessors, 2026-06-06; evidence in commit thread):**
- **Obj 1 "honest number" — ~95% ✅** (FIRE date, Monte-Carlo bands, accessible-money bridge wired
  into the headline, stress test, plan-is-alive). No blocking gap. (#47 dormant.)
- **Obj 0 "effortless setup" (manual) — ~90% ✅** (wizard, 8-section CRUD+persist, smart defaults,
  auto-flow, completeness nudges, estate+glossary real). Gaps: **#42 scroll-lock** (self-heals but
  trust-killer) + named-scenario persistence (polish).
- **Obj 2 "get there faster" — ~35% ⚠️ THE must-have gap.** Missing the **lever-impact ranking
  engine** (the core of the objective): no ranking of India-specific levers (regime arbitrage,
  80CCD(1B)/employer-NPS, prepay-vs-invest, savings-rate/step-up, allocation) by years-to-FIRE
  impact with confidence bands; tax levers isolated from FIRE-impact; no celebrate phase. → flagship
  build, tracked as a new issue.

**The must-have-now plan (sequenced):**
1. **Obj-2 flagship — lever-impact ranking engine** (#48; financial math + UI; the hollow core of
   "get there faster"). → IN PROGRESS.
2. ~~#42 scroll-lock~~ **✅ RESOLVED** (2026-06-06) — fix already shipped (`scroll-lock-recovery.ts`
   router safety net @ 8467055/c2176a1), verified live on `main` (spec 4/4, wired at
   `router/index.ts:201`); was a stale-open issue. Closed.
3. **Obj-2 — connect tax/deduction surfaces to FIRE-impact + prepay-vs-invest + celebrate phase**
   (folded into #48's surfacing).
4. **Obj-0 polish — named scenario persistence.**

**Deferred (was the prior focus — resumes after the must-have core):** stickiness/measurement (#44),
retention loop (#45, also gated on comms go-live), Form16/CAS import (#43, nice-to-have).
DPDP/privacy posture for #44 remains a `TODO(5W)` to settle before instrumenting.

**Parallel/queued (not the active focus):**
- **#46 temporal-contributions Phase 1 — ✅ DONE** (merged to `main` @ `c7c70a5`, autonomous `/goal`
  run complete, no deferrals). Time-varying household savings schedule + REAL opt-in step-up lever;
  per-investment schedules persisted but **barred from the corpus headline** (bug-#11 lock) — plan/
  display only. ADR-0004 written. **Two open follow-ups, both non-blocking:** **#47** chart-vs-headline
  nominal/real frame divergence (only bites once a persisted dashboard step-up UI lands; conservative
  direction, never optimistic) + a missing step-up-ceiling persona-sanity spec. **Deploy-gate B7**
  (`docs/comms-go-live-handoff.md`): the authored-not-applied `contributionSchedule` JSONB migration
  ships automatically on the next redeploy (Abhay's gate) — take a Supabase PITR backup first.
- **#43 Form16/CAS import** (obj 0, effortless setup — the buildable activation-gate friction-killer).
- **#42 scroll-lock prod bug**; **#41 business-income tax modelling.**

## §3 — Decision log (append-only, newest first)

### 2026-06-06
- **D-2026-06-06-07 — Reprioritized to COMPLETE THE MUST-HAVE CORE (obj 0+1+2) before stickiness;
  scope = accumulation core, defer obj 3+4 to a later phase.** Abhay's call: complete the app's
  must-have feature set before measuring retention (a working core is the precondition for
  stickiness). A 4-assessor completeness audit found obj 1 ~95% / obj 0 ~90% / **obj 2 ~35% — the
  lever-impact ranking engine is the hollow core**. Obj 3+4 are the wedge persona's later lifecycle
  (math built, UI missing) → sequenced later, NOT must-have-now. Stickiness (#44/#45) + Form16/CAS
  (#43) deferred behind the core. *Why (goal):* serves the LOCKED accumulator persona's "get there
  faster" objective, the biggest must-have gap. → flagship issue (lever engine) + §2 plan.
- **D-2026-06-06-06 — Temporal-contributions Phase 1 SHIPPED to `main`.** Autonomous `/goal` run of the
  #46 contract completed with no deferrals; merged @ `c7c70a5` (+ ADR-0004, the persisted
  `contributionSchedule` column, the What-If step-up lever, plausibility locks). Migration is
  authored-not-applied → tracked as deploy-gate **B7**. Two non-blocking follow-ups filed: **#47**
  (chart/headline frame divergence + step-up-ceiling spec gap). *Why logged:* closes the §2
  "Abhay runs /goal when ready" status; the honesty-objective foundation is now stronger.
- **D-2026-06-06-05 — Created the documentation-management system.** New rule
  `.claude/rules/documentation-management.md` (doc taxonomy + document-on-decision trigger +
  auto-reference protocol) + this `docs/PROJECT-LOG.md` + a `CLAUDE.md` pointer. *Why:* strategic
  decisions had no single durable, auto-referred home and could be forgotten across sessions.
- **D-2026-06-06-04 — Next priority = stickiness/measurement (#44).** *Why:* biggest unproven risk to
  the goal; correctness just served; can't improve unmeasured retention. See §2.
- **D-2026-06-06-03 — Temporal-contributions model FINALIZED + Phase-1 contract authored.** Independent
  FinTech + Architect review resolved the corpus-inflow blocker → **residual-only inflow; per-investment
  schedules barred from corpus (the bug-#11 lock); year-indexed schedule; REAL-terms opt-in step-up;
  age-relative segments.** Contract: `docs/goals/2026-06-06-temporal-contributions-phase1.md`; ADR-0004
  to be written by the run. *Why (goal):* the "frozen-today-forever" projection was the top objective-1
  honesty gap. → issue **#46**.
- **D-2026-06-06-02 — Tracked the untracked buildable frontier as issues.** **#43** Form16/CAS import,
  **#44** analytics instrumentation, **#45** retention delivery loop. *Why:* they lived only in
  roadmap prose; now durably tracked.
- **D-2026-06-06-01 — Goal-achievement assessment: ~30–40% realized.** Correctness strong, stickiness
  unproven, objectives 0/2/3/4 partial-to-early. *Why logged:* the honest baseline that anchors
  prioritization. → §1.
