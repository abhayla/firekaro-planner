/**
 * Lever catalog (objective 2, gh-issue #48) — builds the concrete acceleration LEVERS the
 * `lever-impact` engine ranks. Implements the agreed comparability policy (PROJECT-LOG /
 * issue #48): **realistic max-effort per lever**, each carrying a transparent BOUND note, so a
 * lever's rank reflects its biggest *achievable* win for THIS household — not an arbitrary increment.
 * A lever with no headroom (no surplus, already at the equity ceiling, nothing to trim) is OMITTED
 * (shown locked by the UI), never emitted with a fake impact.
 *
 * This is the first, cleanly-modelable slice — the three levers that perturb the FIRE baseline
 * directly. The INDIA-SPECIFIC tax/financial levers (old↔new regime arbitrage, 80CCD(1B) top-up,
 * employer-NPS ask, prepay-loan-vs-invest) need a tax/interest recomputation to turn "₹ freed" into
 * an extra investable contribution; they are the next increment and attach as more entries here once
 * their modelling is validated. Keep this module pure (`.claude/rules/calculation-modules.md`).
