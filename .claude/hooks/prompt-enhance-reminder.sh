# prompt-enhance-reminder.sh — UserPromptSubmit hook
# Injects the *Enhanced:* indicator + Tier-1 + Grade pipeline reminder so the
# advisory rule cannot be skipped under context pressure.
#
# Trigger gate (added v2): the hook itself filters trivial prompts so the
# strengthening pipeline never runs on continuations or one-word replies.
# This moves the "skip for direct instructions" rule from the model layer
# (where it can be missed) to the deterministic layer.
#
# Skip conditions (no reminder injected):
#   1. Prompt length ≤ 15 characters (after trimming whitespace)
#   2. Prompt matches a known continuation phrase (yes / ok / thanks / next /
#      go ahead / proceed / continue / now do … / same for … / also …)
#
# Configuration:
#   Event: UserPromptSubmit
#   Matcher: (empty — matches all prompts)
#   Exit codes: always 0 (non-blocking)
#   Stdin: JSON payload with `prompt` field (parsed via jq)
#
# Settings.json entry:
#   {
#     "hooks": {
#       "UserPromptSubmit": [
#         {
#           "matcher": "",

#           ]
#         }
#       ]

# Stderr is silenced so a missing jq never surfaces in the conversation.
