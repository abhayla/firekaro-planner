# Stop hook — deterministic STOP-DISCIPLINE guard (over-ask + narrate-and-stop).
#
# WHY (2026-06-04): advisory rules ("decide reversible work, don't ask" +
# "build, don't narrate-and-stop") kept LOSING under long context — I repeatedly
# ended turns either asking a question I should have decided, OR DESCRIBING the
# next step ("next step is edit/delete") and stopping instead of doing it. Per
# rule-writing-meta.md, zero-exception behaviour needs a HOOK, not prose. So this
# hook now BLOCKS the stop and RE-INJECTS the rule so the model keeps going.
#
# Two BLOCKING stop-violation classes detected:
#   A. OVER-ASK — trailing offer / multiple-choice / recommendation+question.
#   B. NARRATE-AND-STOP — ending by describing the NEXT reversible step
#      ("next step is…", "next I'll…", "continuation…", "remaining … tracked",
#      "from here…") instead of executing it.
# On either (and NOT a genuine blocker), it emits {"decision":"block","reason":…}
# to force continuation. A per-user-turn counter (.claude/.keepgoing-count, reset
# by prompt-enhance-reminder.sh) caps auto-continues at 12 to prevent any loop.
#
# Plus one NON-BLOCKING telemetry class (the B-layer backstop, 2026-06-06):
#   C. ENHANCE-BANNER MISS — a substantive assistant turn (>=300 chars) that does
#      NOT open with the *Enhanced:* governance banner. WHY: prompt-enhance-reminder.sh
#      gates on PROMPT shape, so it stays silent on short/command/continuation prompts
#      that still spawn real work (the /init class). Per operating-model.md the banner
#      should fire on OUTPUT blast-radius, not prompt shape — the prompt hook can't see
#      output, this Stop hook can. We LOG the miss to .claude/.enhance-misses.log
#      (telemetry first, rule 22 — escalate to block only if the log shows it's frequent).
#      The behavioral fix is the rule wording in prompt-auto-enhance-rule.md.
