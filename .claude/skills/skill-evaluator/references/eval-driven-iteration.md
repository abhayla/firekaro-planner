# Eval-Driven Iteration

How to test skill output quality using structured evaluations, assertions, and systematic iteration.

## Test Case Design

A test case has three parts:
- **Prompt:** a realistic user message (varied phrasing, detail, formality)
- **Expected output:** human-readable description of what success looks like
- **Input files** (optional): files the skill needs to work with

Store in `evals/evals.json` inside the skill directory. Start with 2-3 test cases — expand after first results.

**Tips:** Include at least one edge case (malformed input, unusual request, ambiguous instruction). Use realistic context — real users mention file paths (`data/sales_2025.csv`), column names, personal context ("my manager asked me to..."). Prompts like "process this data" are too vague to test anything.

```json
{
  "skill_name": "my-skill",
  "evals": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "prompt": "realistic user message here",
      "expected_output": "description of success",
      "files": ["evals/files/input.csv"],
      "assertions": [
        "output includes a summary table",
        "all columns are labeled"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Workspace Structure

```
skill-name-workspace/
└── iteration-1/
    ├── eval-<name>/
    │   ├── with_skill/
    │   │   ├── outputs/
    │   │   ├── timing.json    # {total_tokens, duration_ms}
    │   │   └── grading.json   # {assertion_results, summary}
    │   └── without_skill/
    │       ├── outputs/
    │       ├── timing.json
    │       └── grading.json
    └── benchmark.json          # aggregated stats
```

**You author** `evals/evals.json` by hand. The other files (`grading.json`, `timing.json`, `benchmark.json`) are produced during the eval process — by the agent, scripts, or you.

## Running Evals

- Each run MUST start with clean context (subagent isolation)
- No leftover state from previous runs or skill development
- For each test case: run with-skill AND without-skill (or old version for `--baseline`)
- Capture timing: `{"total_tokens": N, "duration_ms": N}`

## Assertions

Write assertions AFTER the first run — you often don't know what "good" looks like until the skill has run.

**Good assertions:** specific, verifiable
- "The output file is valid JSON"
- "The chart has labeled axes"
- "The report includes at least 3 recommendations"

**Weak assertions:** vague or brittle
- "The output is good" (too vague to grade)
- "Uses exactly the phrase 'Total Revenue: $X'" (too brittle)

Not everything needs an assertion — style and "feel" are caught in human review.

## Grading

Grade each assertion PASS or FAIL with **specific evidence** (quote the output, reference file paths).

For assertions checkable by code (valid JSON, correct row count, file exists), use a verification script — scripts are more reliable than LLM judgment for mechanical checks and reusable across iterations. Use LLM grading for subjective assertions.

```json
{
  "assertion_results": [
    {"text": "The output includes a chart image file", "passed": true, "evidence": "Found chart.png (45KB) in outputs/"},
    {"text": "Both axes are labeled", "passed": false, "evidence": "Y-axis labeled 'Revenue ($)' but X-axis has no label"}
  ],
  "summary": {"passed": 1, "failed": 1, "total": 2, "pass_rate": 0.5}
}
```

**Grading principles:**
- **Require concrete evidence for PASS** — don't give benefit of the doubt. If an assertion says "includes a summary" and the output has a "Summary" section with one vague sentence, that's a FAIL — the label is there but substance isn't.
- **Review assertions themselves** during grading:
  - Always pass in both configs? → too easy, remove or tighten
  - Always fail in both? → broken assertion or impossible task, fix it
  - Unverifiable from output alone? → replace with something checkable

## Blind Comparison (for version upgrades)

When comparing old vs new skill versions:
- Present both outputs to a judge without revealing which is which
- Judge scores holistic qualities: organization, formatting, usability, polish
- Complements assertion grading — two outputs can pass all assertions but differ significantly in overall quality

## Aggregating Benchmarks

Compute summary stats per configuration and save to `benchmark.json`:

```json
{
  "run_summary": {
    "with_skill": {
      "pass_rate": {"mean": 0.83, "stddev": 0.06},
      "time_seconds": {"mean": 45.0, "stddev": 12.0},
      "tokens": {"mean": 3800, "stddev": 400}
    },
    "without_skill": {
      "pass_rate": {"mean": 0.33, "stddev": 0.10},
      "time_seconds": {"mean": 32.0, "stddev": 8.0},
      "tokens": {"mean": 2100, "stddev": 300}
    },
    "delta": {"pass_rate": 0.50, "time_seconds": 13.0, "tokens": 1700}
  }
}
```

The **delta** tells you what the skill costs (more time, more tokens) and what it buys (higher pass rate). A skill that adds 13 seconds but improves pass rate by 50 points is worth it. A skill that doubles tokens for a 2-point gain may not be.

**Note:** `stddev` is only meaningful with multiple runs per eval. In early iterations with 2-3 test cases and single runs, focus on raw pass counts and delta.

## Pattern Analysis

After computing benchmarks:
- **Remove assertions that always pass in both configs** — inflating pass rate without measuring skill value
- **Investigate always-fail in both** — broken assertion, too-hard test, or wrong check
- **Study skill-only-pass** — where skill clearly adds value. Understand WHY — which instructions or scripts made the difference?
- **Tighten for inconsistent results** (high stddev) — the skill's instructions may be ambiguous. Add examples or more specific guidance
- **Check time/token outliers** — if one eval takes 3x longer, read its execution transcript to find the bottleneck

## Execution Trace Review

Read the full trace of what the agent did, not just the final output. Three diagnostic patterns:

| Trace Pattern | Root Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Agent tries multiple approaches before finding one that works | Instructions too vague | Be more specific about which approach to use |
| Agent follows instructions that don't apply to the current task | Too many instructions, no conditional gating | Add "only if X" conditions, or move to reference with conditional read |
| Agent spends time choosing between options | Too many equal options, no default | Pick a default, mention alternatives briefly |

## Skill Navigation Observation

Beyond execution traces, observe HOW Claude navigates the skill's file structure:

| Observation | Signal | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Reads files in unexpected order | Structure isn't intuitive | Reorganize directory, clarify pointers in SKILL.md |
| Fails to follow reference links | Links not explicit enough | Use `**Read:** file.md` format, not inline links |
| Repeatedly reads the same reference | Content should be more accessible | Promote key content to SKILL.md body |
| Never accesses a bundled file | File poorly signaled or unnecessary | Improve pointer text or remove the file |
| Uses `head -100` on a reference | File too long, no TOC | Add table of contents at top |

**When to check:** During scenario runs (Step 3.3), review not just the
output but which files Claude read, in what order, and whether any were
skipped or partially read. This reveals information architecture problems
that assertion-based testing misses.

## Adversarial Categories

10 categories for stress testing — pick most realistic for the skill's domain:

1. **Ambiguous request** — could trigger 2+ different paths
2. **Off-topic query** — valid but outside skill's scope
3. **Conflicting constraints** — contradictory requirements
4. **Oversized input** — very long argument, huge file
5. **Minimal/empty input** — "", whitespace, no argument
6. **Partial prerequisite** — some required files missing
7. **Repeated invocation** — same target twice
8. **Malformed format** — wrong type, invalid JSON, typos in flags
9. **Stale context** — outdated input, state has changed
10. **Adversarial phrasing** — same intent, confusing wording

**Severity:** CRITICAL (wrong output, data loss) > MAJOR (partial, misleading) > MINOR (cosmetic, vague error) > PASS (handled correctly)

## Human Review

- Review actual outputs alongside grades for each test case
- Record specific, actionable feedback per case (not "looks bad")
- Empty feedback = output passed review
- Save as `feedback.json` alongside eval directories

## The Iteration Loop

Three signal sources feed each iteration:
1. **Failed assertions** → specific gaps (missing step, unclear instruction)
2. **Human feedback** → broader quality issues (wrong approach, unhelpful structure)
3. **Execution traces** → WHY things went wrong (not just what)

Feed all three + current SKILL.md → propose improvements with these guidelines:

- **Generalize from feedback** — fix underlying issues broadly, not narrow patches for specific test cases
- **Keep the skill lean** — fewer, better instructions outperform exhaustive rules. If pass rates plateau despite adding more rules, try REMOVING instructions
- **Explain the why** — "Do X because Y causes Z" works better than "ALWAYS do X, NEVER do Y"
- **Bundle repeated work** — if every run independently builds similar helper logic, write a tested script in `scripts/`

## Stop Criteria

Stop iterating when:
- Satisfied with results across all test cases
- Human feedback is consistently empty
- No meaningful improvement between iterations
- 5 iterations completed without convergence → escalate to user
