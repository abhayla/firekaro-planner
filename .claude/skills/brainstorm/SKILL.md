# Brainstorm — Socratic Exploration & Spec Writing

Structured exploration of a problem space before committing to implementation.
MUST NOT skip Step 1 questioning. MUST NOT begin implementation — this skill
produces specs, not code. For trivial changes (single field, config tweak),
suggest the user skip brainstorm and use `/implement` directly.

**Topic:** $ARGUMENTS

---

## STEP 1: Understand Intent

Ask 3-5 probing questions before proposing anything. Do NOT skip this step even if the request seems simple.

1. **Who is the user?** Who will use this feature and in what context?
2. **What problem does this solve?** What is painful or missing today?
3. **What does success look like?** How will we know this works?
4. **What are the constraints?** Time budget, tech stack limitations, scope boundaries?
5. **What is out of scope?** What should this explicitly NOT do?

Wait for answers before proceeding. If the user says "just build it," push back once — misunderstood requirements cost more than five questions.

---

## STEP 2: Deep Research

Conduct thorough research before proposing anything. Delegate to subagents for breadth.

### 2.1 Internal Codebase Research
1. Identify existing patterns, modules, and conventions relevant to the request
2. Find related code that this feature must integrate with or extend
3. Surface edge cases, potential conflicts, and architectural constraints
4. Note any prior attempts or partial implementations

### 2.2 External Research (when applicable)
5. **Similar implementations** — Search for how other projects solve this problem. Look for open-source implementations, blog posts, or Stack Overflow discussions with concrete patterns.
6. **Documentation & standards** — Review official documentation for relevant libraries, APIs, or protocols. Check for best practices, known pitfalls, and recommended patterns.
7. **Design patterns** — Identify applicable design patterns (e.g., event sourcing, CQRS, circuit breaker, saga). Reference pattern names so the team has shared vocabulary.
8. **Known failure modes** — Research common mistakes when implementing this type of feature. What do post-mortems say? What do "things I wish I knew" articles highlight?

### 2.3 Research Brief
Summarize findings in a structured brief before moving to approaches:

```
Research Brief:
- Internal: <what exists, what we can reuse, what constrains us>
- External: <how others solve this, recommended patterns>
- Risks: <known failure modes, common mistakes>
- Open questions: <what we still don't know>
```

## STEP 3: Propose Approaches

Present 2-3 distinct approaches. For each, include a one-paragraph description and the trade-offs table:

| Criteria | Approach A | Approach B | Approach C |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Complexity | | | |
| Maintainability | | | |
| Performance | | | |
| Time to implement | | | |
| Risk | | | |

**Recommend one approach** with clear reasoning. Explain why the others are worse for this specific situation, not in general.

Wait for user approval before proceeding. If the user picks a different approach, switch without resistance.

---

## STEP 4: Design in Sections

Break the chosen approach into logical sections. Present each section one at a time for incremental review:

- **Data model changes** — New or modified schemas, types, or structures
- **API / interface changes** — New endpoints, function signatures, or contracts
- **UI changes** — Screens, components, or user-facing behavior (if applicable)
- **Migration needs** — Data migrations, feature flags, backward compatibility
- **Integration points** — How this connects to existing systems

Do NOT present everything at once. Walk through section by section, waiting for feedback on each before moving to the next.

---

## STEP 5: Write Spec Document

Produce a concise spec containing:

1. **Problem statement** — What we are solving and why
2. **Chosen approach** — Which approach was selected and the reasoning
3. **Design sections** — Details from Step 4, refined with feedback
4. **Requirement tiers** — Classify every requirement:
   - **Must** — Non-negotiable for the feature to ship
   - **Nice** — Valuable but deferrable to a follow-up
   - **Out of Scope** — Explicitly excluded to prevent scope creep
5. **Open questions** — Anything still unresolved
6. **Success criteria** — Measurable outcomes that prove this works

Save the spec to a location the user specifies. If no preference, suggest `docs/specs/{feature-name}-spec.md`.

The spec is a living document — update it as understanding evolves during implementation.

### Step 5 Alternative: PRD (Product Requirements Document)

If the user needs formal requirements (for team handoff, stakeholder review, or project tracking), produce a PRD instead of a spec. Ask: "Do you need a spec (technical) or PRD (product-facing)?"

PRD format (IEEE 830 aligned):

```markdown
# PRD: <Feature Name>

## Meta
- Author: <name or "Claude Code">
- Date: <ISO-8601>
- Status: DRAFT | REVIEW | APPROVED
- Version: 1.0

## Scope

## Stakeholders & RACI
| Role | Person/Team | R(esponsible) | A(ccountable) | C(onsulted) | I(nformed) |

## STEP 6: Handoff

Summarize the spec/PRD in 3-5 bullet points and suggest the appropriate next step:

- **`/writing-plans`** — For features that need detailed task breakdown before implementation
- **`/implement`** — For well-scoped features ready to build directly
- **`/plan-to-issues`** — For PRDs that need to be tracked as GitHub Issues with epics
- **`/adversarial-review`** — For high-risk features that need plan review before execution

---

## MUST DO

- Always complete Step 1 questioning, even for "obvious" requests — Why: skipped questions lead to misunderstood requirements and wasted implementation effort
- Always present trade-offs across multiple approaches, not just the "best" option — Why: users need to make informed decisions, not accept your first instinct
- Always wait for user approval between Steps 3, 4, and 5 — Why: incremental alignment prevents costly late-stage redesigns
- Always ground proposals in actual codebase research (Step 2) — Why: proposals disconnected from the codebase create unrealistic plans
- Update the spec document when new information surfaces — Why: stale specs cause implementation drift

## MUST NOT DO

- MUST NOT skip questioning and jump straight to solutions — Why: premature solutions solve the wrong problem
- MUST NOT present a single approach as the only option — always offer alternatives — Why: users lose trust when they suspect you're anchoring
- MUST NOT dump the entire design at once — present section by section — Why: cognitive overload causes users to rubber-stamp instead of review
- MUST NOT treat the spec as final — it evolves with the conversation — Why: rigid specs break on contact with reality
- MUST NOT begin implementation during this skill — brainstorm produces a spec, not code — Why: mixing exploration and execution leads to premature commitment
