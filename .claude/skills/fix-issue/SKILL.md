# Fix GitHub Issue

Fetch a GitHub Issue, diagnose root cause, implement a minimal fix, verify with tests, and finalize via post-fix-pipeline.

**Critical:** This skill requires `gh` CLI authenticated. If $ARGUMENTS is empty, ask the user for the issue number. Always fetch the issue first — never guess what the issue is about. Delegate test failures to `/fix-loop`, not manual retry.

**Issue:** $ARGUMENTS

---

## STEP 1: Fetch and Parse Issue

**Extract issue number** from `$ARGUMENTS`:
- `#42` or `42` → use `42`
- `https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/42` → extract `42`
- If no number found, ask the user

```bash
gh issue view $ISSUE_NUMBER --json title,body,labels,assignees,comments,state
```

**Error handling:**

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `gh` not authenticated | Report: "Run `gh auth login` first" → STOP |
| Issue not found | Report: "Issue #N not found in this repo" → STOP |
| Issue state is `CLOSED` | Confirm with user: "Issue #N is already closed. Continue anyway?" |
| No repro steps for a bug | Derive repro hypothesis from description; flag as assumption |

**Parse the issue into a structured brief:**
```markdown
**Title:** <issue title>
**Type:** bug | feature | enhancement | chore
**Repro steps:** <from body, or derived hypothesis>
**Expected:** <expected behavior>
**Actual:** <current behavior>
**Mentioned files/components:** <extracted from body and comments>
**Labels:** <issue labels>
```

## STEP 2: Explore and Diagnose

Search the codebase for root cause (bugs) or implementation location (features):

1. **Grep** for keywords, error messages, and component names from the issue brief
2. **Read** the 2-3 most relevant source files identified by search
3. **Read** existing tests in the affected area to understand current coverage
4. **Check** git blame on suspected lines to understand recent changes

**Decision point:**

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Root cause is clear after exploration | Proceed to Step 3 |
| Root cause unclear after 10+ minutes of exploration | Escalate: `Skill("systematic-debugging", args="<issue brief>")` and use its diagnosis output |
| Issue is a feature request with complex requirements | Escalate: `Skill("implement", args="<parsed requirements from issue>")` then skip to Step 4 |

## STEP 3: Implement and Test

1. **Write a failing test** that reproduces the bug (or defines the feature behavior)
2. **Implement the minimal fix** — change only what the issue requires
3. **Run targeted tests** for the changed area
4. **If tests fail**, delegate: `Skill("fix-loop", args="<failure output> retest_command: <cmd>")`
5. **Run broader test suite** for regression check

**Scope guard:** If the fix requires changes to > 3 files, confirm approach with user before proceeding. Large fixes often indicate a misdiagnosed root cause.

## STEP 4: Finalize

**Mode detection:** check `$ARGUMENTS` for `--diff-only` flag.

### Default mode (no flag)

Run the post-fix pipeline to commit, document, and capture learnings:

```
Skill("post-fix-pipeline", args="fixes_applied: [summary of changes] issue: #$ISSUE_NUMBER")
```

If `post-fix-pipeline` is not available, manually:
1. Commit with conventional message: `fix: resolve #N — <description>`
2. Update docs if behavior changed
3. Capture learnings via `Skill("learn-n-improve", args="session")`

### `--diff-only` mode (NEW in PR2 of test-pipeline-three-lane spec)

When `--diff-only` is present in `$ARGUMENTS`, **skip `/post-fix-pipeline` entirely**. Instead:

1. Capture the proposed changes as a unified diff:
   ```bash
   git diff --staged > test-results/fixes/${ISSUE_NUMBER}.diff
   # If nothing staged but working-tree has changes:
   git diff > test-results/fixes/${ISSUE_NUMBER}.diff
   ```
2. Reset the working tree to clean state:
   ```bash
   git stash push -u -m "fix-issue-diff-only-${ISSUE_NUMBER}" || git reset --hard HEAD
   ```
3. Return contract:
   ```json
   {
     "result": "DIFF_WRITTEN",
     "issue_number": ${ISSUE_NUMBER},
     "diff_path": "test-results/fixes/${ISSUE_NUMBER}.diff",
     "no_commit": true,
     "reason": "Caller (test-healer-agent in commit_mode=diff_only) will batch-apply via /serialize-fixes"
   }
   ```

**Why diff-only mode exists:** the three-lane test pipeline's `/test-pipeline` skill (spec v2.2, skill-at-T0) dispatches multiple parallel fixers in one T0 message at STEP 6 TRIAGE Fan-out 3. Each fixer must NOT commit independently (parallel commits race on the working tree). T0 collects all diffs, then invokes `/serialize-fixes` to apply them sequentially with `git apply --check` first. See spec v2.2 §3.3.

**Backward compat:** Default mode (no flag) is unchanged — existing `/fix-loop`, development-loop, and direct user invocations continue to work as before. Spec §3.14.

## STEP 5: Summarize

```markdown
## Fix Summary: Issue #N — <title>

**Root cause:** <1-2 sentences>
**Fix:** <what was changed and why>
**Files changed:** <list>
**Tests:** <added/modified/verified>
**Follow-up:** <items or "none">
```

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Prevention |
|---------|-----------|
| `gh` not installed or authenticated | Check in Step 1 before any code exploration |
| Issue body is vague or missing repro steps | Derive hypothesis and flag as assumption — do not guess silently |
| Root cause misdiagnosed → fix doesn't resolve issue | Write reproducing test FIRST (Step 3) — if test doesn't fail, diagnosis is wrong |
| Fix touches too many files → scope creep | Enforce 3-file scope guard; escalate to user if exceeded |
| Post-fix-pipeline unavailable | Graceful fallback to manual commit + docs + learnings |

---

## CRITICAL RULES

- MUST fetch the GitHub Issue via `gh issue view` before any code changes — Why: the issue body is the source of truth; guessing from title alone leads to wrong fixes
- MUST write a failing test before implementing the fix — Why: a test that doesn't fail before the fix proves nothing; TDD catches misdiagnosed root causes
- MUST verify with tests before declaring done — Why: untested fixes create false confidence and break in production
- MUST confirm approach with user if fix requires > 3 files — Why: large fixes usually indicate misdiagnosed root cause or scope creep
- MUST NOT guess issue content from the title alone — Why: titles are often misleading; the body and comments contain the real context
- MUST NOT implement unrelated improvements while fixing — Why: scope discipline prevents regressions and keeps PRs reviewable. Use a separate PR instead
- MUST NOT skip post-fix-pipeline — Why: uncommitted fixes are lost fixes; learnings not captured repeat as future mistakes
