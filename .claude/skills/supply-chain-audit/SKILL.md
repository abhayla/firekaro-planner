# Supply Chain Audit

Audit the software supply chain for vulnerable, malicious, abandoned, or non-compliant dependencies.

**Request:** $ARGUMENTS

---

## STEP 1: Dependency Inventory

Enumerate all direct and transitive dependencies.

### Detect Package Ecosystem

```bash
# Identify manifest files
find . -maxdepth 3 \( \
  -name "package.json" -o -name "package-lock.json" -o -name "yarn.lock" -o -name "pnpm-lock.yaml" \
  -o -name "requirements.txt" -o -name "Pipfile" -o -name "Pipfile.lock" -o -name "pyproject.toml" -o -name "poetry.lock" \
  -o -name "Cargo.toml" -o -name "Cargo.lock" \
  -o -name "go.mod" -o -name "go.sum" \
  -o -name "Gemfile" -o -name "Gemfile.lock" \
  -o -name "pom.xml" -o -name "build.gradle" -o -name "build.gradle.kts" \
  \) 2>/dev/null
```

### Extract Dependencies

| Ecosystem | List Direct | List All (Transitive) |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| npm | `npm ls --depth=0` | `npm ls --all` |
| pip | `pip freeze` or parse `requirements.txt` | `pipdeptree` |
| Cargo | `cargo metadata --no-deps` | `cargo tree` |
| Go | `go list -m -json all` | `go mod graph` |
| Ruby | `bundle list` | `bundle viz` (graphviz) |
| Maven | `mvn dependency:list` | `mvn dependency:tree` |
| Gradle | `gradle dependencies --configuration runtimeClasspath` | Same with `--scan` |

### Dependency Count Summary

Record totals in this format:

```
Ecosystem: [npm/pip/cargo/go/...]
Direct dependencies: X
Transitive dependencies: Y
Total unique packages: Z
```

---

## STEP 2: Vulnerability Scanning

Run ecosystem-specific vulnerability scanners.

### Scanner Commands

```bash
# Node.js / npm
npm audit --json > npm-audit.json 2>/dev/null
npm audit --audit-level=high

# Python / pip
pip-audit --format=json --output=pip-audit.json 2>/dev/null
pip-audit

# Python / safety (alternative)
safety check --json --output=safety-report.json 2>/dev/null

# Rust / Cargo
cargo audit --json > cargo-audit.json 2>/dev/null
cargo audit

# Ruby / Bundler
bundle-audit check --update
bundle-audit check --format=json > bundle-audit.json 2>/dev/null

# Go
govulncheck ./... 2>&1 | tee govulncheck-report.txt

# Multi-ecosystem (if available)
osv-scanner --format=json --output=osv-report.json -r . 2>/dev/null
```

### Triage Vulnerability Results

For each CVE/advisory found:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **CVE/GHSA ID** | Unique identifier |
| **Package** | Affected package name and version |
| **Severity** | CVSS score and qualitative rating |
| **Fixed in** | Version that resolves the issue |
| **Reachability** | Is the vulnerable code path actually called? |
| **Exploitability** | Is there a public exploit or PoC? |
| **Upgrade path** | Can the fix be applied without breaking changes? |

---

## STEP 3: Typosquatting Detection

Check for packages that may be impersonations of popular libraries.

### Common Typosquatting Patterns

| Pattern | Example | Legitimate |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Character swap | `reqeusts` | `requests` |
| Prefix addition | `python-requests` | `requests` |
| Suffix addition | `requests-py` | `requests` |
| Hyphen/underscore swap | `python_dateutil` vs `python-dateutil` | Check PyPI/npm directly |
| Scope squatting (npm) | `@my-org/lodash` | `lodash` |
| Combosquatting | `requests-utils` | `requests` + `utils` |

### Detection Workflow

```bash
# Extract all package names from manifests
# npm
cat package.json | python3 -c "
import json, sys
pkg = json.load(sys.stdin)
for dep_type in ['dependencies', 'devDependencies', 'peerDependencies']:
    for name in pkg.get(dep_type, {}):
        print(name)
" 2>/dev/null | sort

# pip (requirements.txt)
grep -v "^#\|^$\|^-" requirements.txt 2>/dev/null | sed 's/[><=!].*//' | sed 's/\[.*//' | sort

# For each package, verify:
# 1. Package exists on the official registry
# 2. Package name is not suspiciously similar to a popular package
# 3. Publisher/maintainer is consistent with expectations
```

### Red Flags

- Package published within last 30 days with a name similar to a popular package
- Single maintainer with no other packages
- Package description copied from another package
- Minimal or empty source code with install hooks (`preinstall`, `postinstall`)
- Sudden spike in downloads followed by plateau

---

## STEP 4: Abandoned Package Detection

Identify unmaintained dependencies that may accumulate unpatched vulnerabilities.

### Health Indicators

| Indicator | Healthy | Warning | Abandoned |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Last publish | < 6 months | 6-18 months | > 18 months |
| Open issues ratio | < 30% | 30-60% | > 60% |
| Maintainer count | 2+ | 1 | 0 or unresponsive |
| Last commit | < 3 months | 3-12 months | > 12 months |
| CI status | Passing | Flaky | Failing or absent |
| Deprecation notice | None | Soft deprecation | Officially deprecated |

### Check Commands

```bash
# npm: check package metadata
npm view <package-name> time --json 2>/dev/null | python3 -c "
import json, sys
from datetime import datetime, timezone
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
latest = max(v for k, v in data.items() if k not in ('created', 'modified'))
age_days = (datetime.now(timezone.utc) - datetime.fromisoformat(latest.replace('Z', '+00:00'))).days
print(f'Last published: {latest} ({age_days} days ago)')
"

# npm: check maintainers
npm view <package-name> maintainers --json 2>/dev/null

# PyPI: check release history
pip index versions <package-name> 2>/dev/null
```

---

## STEP 5: License Compliance

Identify license obligations and incompatibilities.

### SPDX License Identification

```bash
# npm: list all licenses
npx license-checker --json --production > licenses.json 2>/dev/null
npx license-checker --summary --production

# pip: list licenses
pip-licenses --format=json --output-file=licenses.json 2>/dev/null
pip-licenses --summary

# Cargo
cargo license --json > licenses.json 2>/dev/null

# Go
go-licenses report ./... 2>/dev/null
```

### License Compatibility Matrix

| License | Permissive Use | Must Distribute Source | Copyleft Risk |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|---------------|
| MIT | Yes | No | None |
| Apache-2.0 | Yes | No (patent grant) | None |
| BSD-2/3 | Yes | No | None |
| ISC | Yes | No | None |
| MPL-2.0 | Yes | File-level only | Low |
| LGPL-2.1/3.0 | Yes (dynamic link) | Modified LGPL files | Medium |
| GPL-2.0/3.0 | Restricted | Entire combined work | High |
| AGPL-3.0 | Restricted (network use) | Entire combined work | Critical |
| SSPL | Restricted | Entire stack | Critical |
| Unlicensed / NONE | Unknown | Unknown | Requires legal review |

### Red Flags

- Any AGPL/SSPL dependency in a proprietary SaaS product
- GPL dependency linked statically into a non-GPL project
- Dependencies with no license file or `UNLICENSED` marker
- License changed between versions (check changelog)

---

## STEP 6: Lockfile Integrity Verification

Verify lockfiles are present, consistent, and untampered.

### Verification Checks

```bash
# npm: verify lockfile integrity
npm ci --dry-run 2>&1 | head -20

# Check for lockfile existence
for lockfile in package-lock.json yarn.lock pnpm-lock.yaml Pipfile.lock poetry.lock Cargo.lock Gemfile.lock go.sum; do
  if [ -f "$lockfile" ]; then
    echo "FOUND: $lockfile ($(wc -l < "$lockfile") lines)"
  fi
done

# Check lockfile is in version control
git ls-files --error-unmatch package-lock.json 2>/dev/null && echo "Tracked" || echo "NOT tracked in git"

# Detect lockfile/manifest drift
npm ls 2>&1 | grep "WARN\|ERR" | head -10
```

### Lockfile Checklist

- [ ] Lockfile exists for every manifest file
- [ ] Lockfile is tracked in git (not `.gitignore`d)
- [ ] Lockfile matches manifest (no drift: run `npm ci` or `pip install --require-hashes`)
- [ ] Integrity hashes present (npm: `integrity` field; pip: `--require-hashes`)
- [ ] No unexpected registry URLs (check for private registry tampering)
- [ ] Lockfile was not manually edited (check git blame for human edits)

---

## STEP 7: Remediation

Prioritize and fix identified issues.

### Remediation Priority

| Priority | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| P0 — Immediate | Known exploited CVE, critical severity | Upgrade or patch within 24 hours |
| P1 — Urgent | High severity CVE with public PoC | Upgrade within 1 week |
| P2 — Standard | Medium severity or no public exploit | Upgrade in next release cycle |
| P3 — Track | Low severity, no exploit, defense-in-depth | Add to backlog, monitor |

### Upgrade Strategies

```bash
# npm: check for available upgrades
npm outdated --long
npx npm-check-updates

# pip: check for upgrades
pip list --outdated --format=json

# Direct upgrade (single package)
npm install <package>@latest
pip install --upgrade <package>

# Major version upgrade (test thoroughly)
npx npm-check-updates -u --target=latest
npm install
npm test
```

### When Direct Upgrade Breaks Compatibility

1. **Pin to latest safe version** that fixes the CVE without breaking changes
2. **Find alternative package** with equivalent functionality and better maintenance
3. **Vendor the dependency** and apply the security patch manually (last resort)
4. **Accept the risk** with documented justification and compensating controls (e.g., WAF rule)

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Recovery |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `npm audit` returns no results | Private registry without advisory database | Use `osv-scanner` as an alternative cross-ecosystem scanner |
| `pip-audit` not found | Not installed | Install via `pip install pip-audit` |
| Lockfile drift detected | Manual edits or partial installs | Delete lockfile, run clean install (`npm ci` / `pip install`), recommit |
| License checker shows "UNKNOWN" | Package missing license field in metadata | Check the package repository directly for LICENSE file |
| Scanner reports CVE in dev dependency | Dev-only dependency not in production | Document as lower risk but still upgrade — dev dependencies run in CI |
| Too many transitive vulnerabilities | Deep dependency tree with old nested deps | Use `npm audit fix --force` cautiously or override specific versions with `overrides` field |
| Typosquatting check flags legitimate package | Name is genuinely similar to another | Verify on official registry; document as reviewed and safe |

---

## CRITICAL RULES

### MUST DO

- Scan ALL ecosystems present in the project — do not skip secondary manifests (e.g., docs site `package.json`)
- Verify lockfile existence and git tracking for every manifest
- Check reachability for each CVE — transitive vulnerabilities in unused code paths are lower priority
- Include CVSS score and exploitability assessment for every vulnerability reported
- Provide specific upgrade commands for each remediation recommendation
- Flag any dependency with no license as requiring legal review
- Record the scanner versions used in the report for reproducibility

### MUST NOT DO

- Mark a CVE as "not applicable" without verifying the code path is unreachable — use call graph analysis instead
- Recommend `npm audit fix --force` without reviewing what major version bumps it introduces
- Ignore dev/build dependencies — they execute in CI/CD pipelines which are privileged environments
- Trust package names at face value — always verify against the official registry
- Skip lockfile verification — lockfile tampering is a documented supply chain attack vector
- Report license issues without checking the actual license file — metadata can be outdated or wrong
